Description:

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence (Fn):

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, ...

such as

    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.

Given a number, say prod (for product), we search two Fibonacci numbers F(n) and F(n+1) verifying

    F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

Your function productFib takes an integer (prod) and returns an array:

[F(n), F(n+1), true] or {F(n), F(n+1), 1} or (F(n), F(n+1), True)

depending on the language if F(n) * F(n+1) = prod.

If you don't find two consecutive F(n) verifying F(n) * F(n+1) = prodyou will return

[F(n), F(n+1), false] or {F(n), F(n+1), 0} or (F(n), F(n+1), False)

F(n) being the smallest one such as F(n) * F(n+1) > prod.
Some Examples of Return:

(depend on the language)

productFib(714) # should return (21, 34, true), 
                # since F(8) = 21, F(9) = 34 and 714 = 21 * 34

productFib(800) # should return (34, 55, false), 
                # since F(8) = 21, F(9) = 34, F(10) = 55 and 21 * 34 < 800 < 34 * 55
-----
productFib(714) # should return [21, 34, true], 
productFib(800) # should return [34, 55, false], 
-----
productFib(714) # should return {21, 34, 1}, 
productFib(800) # should return {34, 55, 0},        
-----
productFib(714) # should return {21, 34, true}, 
productFib(800) # should return {34, 55, false}, 

Note:

    You can see examples for your language in "Sample Tests".

# Solution
def productFib(prod):

    while True:
        fn = fiblst[-2]
        fn1 = fiblst[-1]
    
        if fn * fn1 == prod:
            return [fn, fn1, True]
            break
        
        elif fn * fn1 > prod:
            return [fn, fn1, False]
            break

        fiblst.append(fn+fn1)
